      With 7 years in design agencies and over a decade of freelancing, I have a
      comprehensive understanding of the dynamic digital design landscape.
    </p>
    <p class="lg:col-span-3">
      As a UX and visual designer, I excel at merging user needs with company
      objectives through practical, systems-oriented design. I tackle complex
      problems by asking insightful questions and delivering efficient, accurate
      results with a touch of humor. At All This, our digital design studio, I
      ensure projects are both visually appealing and highly functional. Outside
      of work, Iâ€™m a music enthusiast who loves to travel, shoot analog photos,
      and cook for friends and family.
